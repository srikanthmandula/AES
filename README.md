# AES
Program “AES.java” to implement the block cipher AES-128.  Specifically, Program will read parameters, key, plaintext and ciphertext from a file named “input.txt” and then it creates a file named “output.txt” by writing the encryption and decryption results to “output.txt”.  In “input.txt”:  1. First line is the coefficients of an irreducible polynomial m(x) (degree is 8) over Z2, from the leading coefficient to the constant term, separated by one blank space.  2. Second line is the key (in hexadecimal format, 32 digits, without blank space).  3. Third line is the plaintext (in hexadecimal format, 32 digits, without blank space).  4. Fourth line is the ciphertext (in hexadecimal format, 32 digits, without blank space).   In “output.txt”:  1. First line is the ciphertext (encryption result of the plaintext in input.txt).  2. Second line is the plaintext (decryption result of the ciphertext in input.txt).
